<h3 align="center">basic python discord bot to get the active devloper badge</h3>

---

#### as u know
- discord has launched a brand-new badge called `active developer` and this is not a limited-time event, and there are no plans to stop offering it.
-  used and got myself and a few more accounts this badges so i decided to share it.
- i really dont mind, just take it. i dont have any license.

#### usage / locahosting 
if u r not plan to host ur bot on the vps or a cloud server pls follow these step:
- create a bot on Dev portal
- get/storage ur bot token (highly recommend dont let someone got your bot token)
- get urseld an IDE 
- install `Node` to run the bot & `Git` to commit, push your code.
- creat a repo and everything is up to u
- get urself `terminal` (in this step i recommend u to use `VScode` to install the dependencies then run the command)
- if you:

> 1. cloned the repo: run the `git clone https://github.com/nnbaocuong99/archived-badge-bot` cd into the 
folder then `npm run run ur_bot_token`


> 2. already cloned or download: basically paste it into the directory u want and run the command `npm run run ur_bot_token` 

---

#### run the command and get ur own the badge
- if ur bot successfully started and got an `online` status, invite it using the URL created on the Dev portal site.
- use the `/hithere` command by type `/` on the chat and select you bot
- if u still uneligible, that is because ur bot is new even brand new and it take abt 24h for ur bot to be fully registered as "active" on discord 
- dont forget to turn on the `"Use data to improve Discord"` in User `settings -> privacy` because at least one person using ur bot need that turned on in order for us to track command events.
