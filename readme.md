<h3 align="center">basic python discord bot to get the active devloper badge</h3>

---

#### ✨ as u know
- discord has launched a brand-new badge called [active developer badge](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10113997751447-Active-Developer-Badge) and this is not a limited-time event, and there are no plans to stop offering it.
- used and got myself and a few more accounts this badges so i decided to share it.
- i really dont mind everybody can make basic bot, just take it. i dont have any license or tried to claim or steal from anyone

#### ✨ usage / locahosting 
if u r not plan to host ur bot on the vps or a cloud server pls follow these step:
- on [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) create an appplication and build a bot.
- click `reset token` to get or bot token 
- on your device, install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run your bot and you also need [Git](https://git-scm.com) to control your source code, repo,...
- if u dont have any IDE get urself 1 (for example VScode) or a `terminal` in the directory. 
- if you:

⚠️ dont have this repo on ur device: 

1. run this command to clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/nnbaocuong99/archived-badge-bot` 
2. use an IDE to open the project or basically open a terminal in the directory (if you opened a terminal in another location remember to `cd` into the project folder) then run `npm install` / `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. run this command `npm run ur_bot_token` 

⚠️ already cloned or downloaded the source code: 

1. use vscode to open it and run `npm install` / `npm i` on the terminal. cd into the directory if u use any single terminal and run the same command to install the dependencies.

2. run this command `npm run ur_bot_token`

#### ✨ run the command and get ur own the badge

- if ur bot successfully started and got an `online` status, invite it using the URL created on the Dev portal site.
- use the `/hithere` command by type `/` on the chat and select you bot
- if u still uneligible, that is because ur bot is new even brand new and it take abt 24h for ur bot to be fully registered as "active" on discord 
- dont forget to turn on the `"Use data to improve Discord"` in User `settings -> privacy` because at least one person using ur bot need that turned on in order for us to track command events.
